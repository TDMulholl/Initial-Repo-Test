# Initial-Repo-Test
This is a basic repository which will be for testing  branches, pushes, commits, and opening/merging a pull request.

This is not my first expeience with a git-like repository. I have used the built-in git system in netbeans as well as tinkered with a piece of software known as "Git Kracken".

Despite this, I figured following the built in tutorial on github would be beneficial. That is the purpose of this repository.
